# GCP Agent Policies enable automated installation and maintenance of the Google Cloud's operations suite agents across 
# a fleet of VMs that match user-specified criteria. Investigated into creating Agent Policy using Terraform on Feb 8, 2022, 
# but Agent Policy couldn't be created even though all system requirements were met, and required roles were assigned to 
# the service account. Needs further investigation, please see the doc for creating Agent Policy using automation tools at:
# https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-operations/google/latest/submodules/agent-policy
